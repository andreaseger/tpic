twitter picture downloader
===

very simple tool to download all picture in the last upto 3200 tweets of an
account. (more would be possible but after 3200 you run into the api limit)


- needs twitter auth token in auth.yml
- use it like this

``` sh
ruby tpic.rb TWITTERHANDLE NUMBER_OF_TWEETS_TO_SEARCH_FOR_PICTURES
```

## what it does not

- handle vines (it will probably just do stupid stuff if there is a vine in the timeline havn't tested that)
- anything regarding external picture sources like instagram
